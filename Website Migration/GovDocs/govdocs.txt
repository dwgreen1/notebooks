<h2 dir="ltr">Depository Library Information</h2>

<p dir="ltr">We are a Congressionally-designated depository for U.S. Government Publications. Traditionally referred to as Government Documents, these publications may be found in a variety of formats including bound and unbound print collections (books, reports, brochures &amp; pamphlets); kits with print booklets and three-dimensional items; website content (webpages &amp; attached digital files); CDs &amp; DVDs; maps; microfilm &amp; microfiche; posters and collections of printed illustrations. Public access to &nbsp;government documents collections is guaranteed by public law (Title 44 United States Code).</p>

<p dir="ltr">The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/libraries/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=federal-depository-library-program" target="" title="">Federal Depository Library Program</a> (FDLP) was established by Congress to ensure that the American public has access to its Government’s information. The Program originated in the early 1800’s when a joint resolution of Congress directed that additional copies of the House and Senate Journals and other documents be printed and distributed to institutions outside the Federal establishment. Over the years the Depository Library System has expanded and today there are nearly 1,250 participating libraries.</p>

<p dir="ltr">GPO (Government Publishing Office) administers the FDLP on behalf of the participating libraries and the public. Information products from the Federal Government are disseminated to these nationwide libraries that, in turn, ensure the American public has free access to the materials, both in print and online.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Selective depository libraries choose publications and services that best meet the Federal government information needs of their local communities. Fifty regional depository libraries receive every unclassified government publication of interest to the public.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><br />
Federal Publications</h3>

<p dir="ltr">Our Government Information Services section contains over 1 million publications, dating from the 1700s to the present. Most materials from 1976 forward appear in the <a href="http://catalog.library.ohio.gov/search/g" target="" title="">online catalog</a>. Older holdings can be located in paper indexes and in the <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">Non–Depository Index and Microfiche Sets</span> in the library.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The collection includes federal legislation, laws, and regulations (United States Code; Code Of Federal Regulations; Federal Register; Congressional bills, hearings, and reports); current and historic census data, topographic maps; and social, economic, and environmental statistics. Many sources are available online. <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/" target="" title="">GovInfo</a>, an online system to Federal legislation, is available and updated on a daily basis.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">State Publications</h3>

<p dir="ltr">Since its inception in 1817, the State Library has collected state government publications of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, and any board, or commission of state government intended for general public use and distribution. The Library is the official Ohio government documents depository and houses the largest collection of Ohio’s state publications in the United States. We receive and make available state government publications as mandated by <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/149.11" target="" title="">ORC 149.11</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Some of the types of Ohio documents that can be found include:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>House and Senate Journals</li>
	<li>Laws of Ohio</li>

	<li>Ohio Administrative Code (O.A.C.) (rules)</li>
	<li>Ohio Supreme Court and Appellate Court decisions</li>

Links to the digital publications are accessible from <a href="http://catalog.library.ohio.gov/" target="" title="">the State Library’s catalog</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">If our collection includes more than one print copy of a document, it may circulate. Items that are fragile or published prior to 1950 do not circulate, but are available to use in the library. We will scan and email a reasonable number of pages from items that do not circulate as staff time permits.</p>
